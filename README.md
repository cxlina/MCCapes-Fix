# MCCapes-Fix [1.18.2 -> 1.19) - FabricMC]

**NOTE: This Mod isn't version-locked. This means it will NEVER block your game from starting. What might happen tho is that a specific Minecraft-Update breaks the mod's code, which crashes the game. If this happens, please open an issue, and wait until i fix it.**

Fixes the Stuttering in the [Minecraftcapes](https://minecraftcapes.net/) Mod. Requires the Original as well!

The bug is **NOT** caused by the original mod, it's a pesky vanilla bug, which hasn't been fixed by Mojang yet (after over 10 years lmfao).
If one of the Developers is reading this, feel free to include it in the original mod.
